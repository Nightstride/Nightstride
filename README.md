*Hey there! As you already know, I'm Barbara. I have lame h- ok ok, I understand that you already read my short Bio, so there's no need to write it here. (It's also boring to do the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.)*

- I’m currently working on a piece of artwork!
- I’m learning French. (see the line below this one)
- I’m looking for a French buddy who can also speak English. Help me with my French, please!
- You can ask me about anything! (Except for Private Info, of course)
- My pronouns are she/her

I play Genshin Impact, and I have lame humor. Don't mind me! I love to burst random words all of a sudden, so don't get too surprised if I suddenly come at you with a "POTATOE!" while we're talking about programming websites.
