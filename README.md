Hey there! As you already know, I'm Barbara. 

- I’m currently working on a piece of artwork!
- I’m currently learning French. (see the line below this one)
- I’m looking for a French buddy who can also speak English. Help me with my French, please!
- You can ask me about anything! (Except for Private Info, of course)
- My pronouns are she/her

I play Genshin Impact, and I have lame humor. Don't mind me! I love to burst random words all of a sudden, so don't get too surprised if I suddenly come at you with a "POTATOE!" while we're talking about programming websites.
